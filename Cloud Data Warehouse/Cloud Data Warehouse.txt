Scenario:
 A game studio captures player data from its most successful games. The studio wants to analyze the data to increase revenue from in-game purchases 

Action Plan:
 Use the AWS Glue built-in transformation 'Relationalize" to flatten the semi-structured data stored in Amazon S3. Query the transformed data in S3 by using Redshift Spectrum in the Redshift data warehouse.

Cloud Data Warehouse
---------------------
-Use Amazon Athena to query nested JSON data stored in Amazon S3
-Create an AWS Glue job to flatten the data, and then use Athena to query the flatten data
-Use Redshift Spectrum to query the flattened tables in Redshift
-Create and use a materialized view to query data, and note the faster response time

Cloud Data Warehouse DIY Activity
---------------------------------
-Create a materialized view for the total purchases by players (mv_players_purchases_amount)
-Query the created materialized view to find the total purchases by a player with id 12345
-Compare the query reponse time to when the materialized view isnt used(Link below for research):

###
FIrst pass, Unsuccessful. A little confusion but I thought I figured it out. FAILED VALIDATION, Recommend repeat process
second pass, Unsuccessful validation. I did manage to query the desired information but I must have not done it the way it
wanted. Unsure how to proceed. Recommend repeat process.
Alright Let just keep this honest! I must be a fucking idiot, Clearly I am not there yet in terms of my comprehension of complex query design. I want to be but I am not, Not yet atleast. Validation successful. DO NOT OVER THINK IT!!!!!
