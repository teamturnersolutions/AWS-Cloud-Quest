Scenario:
 The management of an Electronics Toll collection company would like to consolidate the billing of the toll plaza'a in the data warehouse
with the most up to date data.

Event Driven Serverless ETL
---------------------------
-Configure S3 event notification to trigger Lambda function
-Create a Glue Crawler to read a Schema from RedShift
-Create a Glue ETL job to move data from S3 bucket to RedShift
-Craete a Glue Workflow to crawl raw data from the S3 bucket and then use Glue job ETL
-Query the data using the RedShift query editor


Event Driven Serverless ETL DIY Activity
-----------------------------------------
-Enable the "Job Metrics" feature in the Glue job
-Re-run the toll_plaza_application lambda function to generate transaction logs
-Query the data using the RedShift query editor


###
Lab run has flaws, Successful validation though. Error report being composed and sent. Need to explore furthur to ensure either wasy will work

Event Driven Serverless ETL
Issue with Step 53/54:
 The instructions call for user to use 'Redshift-Crawler'. Subsequent illustration and instruction in the next step present the utlization of 'S3_Crawler' over the earlier instruction to use 'Redshift-Crawler' instead.
Furthur exploration needed for clarification.
