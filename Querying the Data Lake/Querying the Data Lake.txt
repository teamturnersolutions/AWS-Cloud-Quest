Scenario:
 A financial institution has recently implement a data lake to ingest transactions from all across the city. A credit card issuer has begun to send 
logs of transactions which are being stored in Amazon S3. The financial institutions fraud department wqould like to start analyzing the logs for 
suspicious transactions and would lile a fast and scalable solution to achieve this.

Querying the Data Lake
----------------------
-Run the lambda function to genereate a text file of fake crdit card transactions
-Create an Athena table from exported text file
-Query the table for suspected credit card transactions
-Review the locations of the saved query results

Querying the Data Lake DIY Activity
-----------------------------------
-Drop (delete) the sus_transactions table

###
First attempt, Sloppy and rushed. When dealing with data, Slow down and respect the process
InAthena, Look for the sus_transaction table at the bottom left panel. With-in the panel, Far right. click the elipse (3 dots). That will open up a menu 
that will allow you to drop that specific table with out losing the entire query
