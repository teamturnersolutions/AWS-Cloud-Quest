Image and Video Analysis DIY Activity
---------------------------------------
-Update AWS Lambda code to detect a new label (spaceship)
-Upload the sample spaceship image (spaceship.png) into the S3 bucket
-Validate that the response JSON file recieved in the S3 bucket contains spaceship as a label

###
-In Lambda,Replace a piece of code on line 21 in our lambda function to identify 'spaceship' instead of 'airplane', Dont forget to deploy
that change for the save to take effect. In S3, Go back to the labBucket and upload 'spaceship into the input/ file,
Then navigate to the output/ file and download the response JSON to confirm that 'spaceship' was correctly 
identified. Copy the bucket name and proceed to Validation.
