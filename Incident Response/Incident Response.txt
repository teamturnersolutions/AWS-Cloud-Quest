Case://Incident_Response
Job://A fast food security analyst wants to automate EC2 instance isolation in order to respond to security events in a timely manner.


Incident Response
-----------------
-Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on an Amazon EC2 instance.
-Configure the Amazon CloudWatch agent to ingest application logs. 
-Integrate Amazon SNS. Amazon Cloud watch Logs and Alarms and Lambda to automate the
isolation on an EC2 resource that may have been comprimised by a hacker



Incident Response DIY Activity
-------------------------------
-Create an Amazon SNS subscription to email a notification when an alarm is triggered
(Implement DIY in Step 59)

Solution Validation Method
---------------------------
Test service will confirm that a valid email has been subscribed and confirmed to the same SNS topic that was used during the practice section, The SNS topic
should also have a valid AWS Lambda function subscription.

###
This DIY activity is super easy,The lab itself is very "step" intensive but the activity simply piggy backs off that work. Go to SNS and Subscribe to a subscription
and then route that to your email in which you must confirm. Once those couple steps are complete proceed to Validation.
