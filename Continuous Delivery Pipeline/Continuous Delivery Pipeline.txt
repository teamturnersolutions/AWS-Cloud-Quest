Scenario:




Continuous Delivery Pipeline
----------------------------
-Create an AWS CodeCommit repository
-Use AWS Cloud9 and the AWS SAM command line to create a new serverless application
-Create a build specification for AWS CodeBuild
-Create a continuous delivery pipeline by using AWS CodeBuild
-Push code changes to the repository, which invokes the deployment pipeline


Continuous Delivery Pipeline DIY Activity
------------------------------------------
-Configure an additional action in the deploy stage for manual approval (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/approvals-action-add.html)
Return to your pipeline, Click EDIT and in the deploy stage click 'add action'

###
Multiple initial attempts a failure, Fails at the build stage. Recommend taking a step back and rethink strategy
Identified Issue in instruction, Though any rookie should pick it up. During command 'git add .', Ensure you are in the correct directory that you are instructing 
git to currently use with the "." arguement

#CodeCommit

#CMD

	step_18- (Possible Addition)
         Note to user: Ensure you are in the correct working directory before issueing the 'git add .' command. Not doing so will result to 'BUILD FAILED'
