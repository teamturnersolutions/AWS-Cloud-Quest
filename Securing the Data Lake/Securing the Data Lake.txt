Scenario:
 A bank has several departments, each with it own operational databases. These databases use dfifferent technologies and do not 
connect to each other, so each department can only see its own data. To promote a data-driven culture, The bank decided to export 
data to these  operational databases  to a data lake on S3. The employees are now able to access data from all departments. And 
the bank is able to extract insights from the data lake using Athena.


Securing the Data Lake
-----------------------
-Create an AWS Glue crawler to ingest data into the data lake
-Grant AWS IAM users permissions to access the ingested data
-Create restrictions on sensititve data using AWS Lake Formations
-Test the restrictiions by querying the data with Athena


Securing the Data Lake DIY Activity
-------------------------------------
-Before procedding, please log out of the AWS console then click the open AWS console button at the top
-Grant bank managers access to all data in the table
