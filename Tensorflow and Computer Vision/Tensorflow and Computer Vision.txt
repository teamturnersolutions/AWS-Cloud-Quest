Tensorflow and Computer Vision
-------------------------------
-Import and review the CIFAR-10 dataset
-Train your convolutional neural network (CNN) using a tensorflow network
-Deploy the trained model to a real-time endpoint using Amazon Sagemaker hosting services
-Review the model accuracy and test with a sample image



Tensorflow and Computer Vision DIY Activity
--------------------------------------------
-Run the tensor_flow_DIY.ipynb notebook to identify sign langauge digits
-Use an "ml.m5.xlarge" instance and run 10 epochs to train your model
-Deploy the trained model to a real-time endpoint using Amazon Sagemaker hosting services

###
I had issue's going from the lab to DIY, Try logging out first of lab before trying to start DIY. Launch DIY with the same method and procedure as lab
In Sagemaker Studio, Code Cell 10, Configure the proper S3 bucket, Continue on to Code Cell 20 and Configure the required instance type 'ml.m5.xlarge'
and epochs '10'. Continue to the End. Get the newly created Endpoint Name and proceed to Validation
