Infrastructure as Code
-------------------------
-Provision AWS resources by using an AWS Cloudformation template
-Review the concept of drift detection in cloudformation
-Simulate drift by adding a rule to a security group
-Review how to detect and remediate drift by using an AWS lambda function
-Craete an Amazon Eventbridge schedule to run the lambda function


Infrastructure as Code DIY Activity
-------------------------------------
-Modify the AWS Lambda function to detect and remediate changes to the Amazon EC2 
instance profile
-Simulate drift by changing the EC2 instance profile assigned
-Verify that the updated lambda function corrects the drift

###
DIY is simple, Return to lambda and uncomment a portion of the code at the very bottom and 
WATCH your spacing. Will only validate if the code is proper(Look to the above portion
of the lambda function that identifys the roll back of the security group for any hint2)
