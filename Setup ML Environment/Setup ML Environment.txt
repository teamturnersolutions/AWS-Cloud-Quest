Setup ML Environment
---------------------
-Deploy an Amazon Sagemaker domain
-Launch a Sagemaker Studio machine learning (ML) environment
-Clone a GIT hub repository of sample ML projects
-Upload and walkthrough a sample ML project
-Configure and test a Lambda function to call a sagemaker endpoint


Setup ML Environment DIY Activity
----------------------------------
-Create a new inference endpoint using an instance type of ml.m5.xlarge
-Re-run the lambda function using the newly created endpoint

#Validation/endpoint-name
<endpoint-name>

###
In Sagemaker, Open Studio created during the lab and scroll down till you locate this snippet of code in your notebook (predictor = m.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type="ml.m4.xlarge")) and change 'm4' to 'm5'
and press Shift+Enter to run. Return to the previous tab, Sagemaker, Left Column look for Inference/Endpoints. Your provisioned endpoint will be creating
just wait till status says 'inService'. Copy the name and Vavigate to Lambda, Locate the configuration tab and delete the exisiting endpoint and paste your newly created endpoint. Then run a quick test on the code to make sure configurations were correct. 
Move to Validation once complete, You will need the name of the New instance to Validate.
