Scenario:




Configuring Parallel Data Processing
------------------------
-Create an Amazon SNS topic
-Subscribe two AWS Lambda functions to the topic, One of then with a filter
-Use the Amazon SNS console to send a message to the topic
-Use Amazon Cloudwatch Logs Insights to visualize that the messages were delivered



Configuring Parallel Data Processing DIY Activity
---------------------------------------
-Create a new AWS Lambda function (promotion_services) using the 'lambda_role_diy' IAM role
-Configure this new AWS Lambda function to subscribe to the Amazon SNS topic you have created
-Configure a filter to this subscription with the following criteria: {"distance":[{"numeric":[">", 10]}]}



###
The DIY, Is simple, Just a repeat of the lab with a little creative thinking. Use the existing Lambda functions as a template to create the new one.
Then copy the ARN of the newly created lambda function. Navigate back to SNS, and subscribe the new function like the other functrions during the lab
but with a different filter policy described in the details.
