Scenario:
 Our city taxi service collects and stores large amounts of data. We'd like to use the data to improve our service and be morew efficent. We want to use
Amazon EMR. with Apache Spark, To process the data stored in S3. After the data is processed, Our anaylysts can use Athena to query it with the help of Glue.
 Action Plan:
 Use S3 and EMR to process taxi service data. After it is processed, use AWS Glue and Athena to queery the data for insights

Distributed Large Scale Data Processing
----------------------------------------
-Create an EMR cluster
-Import an EMR notebook and attach it to the cluster
-Run the code in the notebook to process the data using Apache Spark
-Create an AWS Glue table so that the data can be queried outside of the cluster

Distributed Large Scale Data Processing DIY Activity
----------------------------------------------------
-Increase the size of the cluster
-Re-run the code in the notebook
-Note the time differences to complete the queries

###
FIrst Pass, I went ahead and tried to include the DIY portion into the lab. Not sure if this was the cause but while running my jupyter notebook I incurred  a task failure. Recommend Re-run of lab as Instructed exactly.
Scond Pass, Task Failure. I took it slow this time and attempted to follow meticulously but still incurred task failure. Unclear at this point where I am going wrong. I have to be missing an important configuration or the instructions are off. The user lab doesn't line up to the configurations of the platform lab settings. I noticed two instances where the misalignment occured but I dismissed it. Recommend taking a step back and re-attempting with clear eyes.
NOTE: While I signed in to the game server , It did mention they were experiencing issue's with thier ML services, Could be the reason for the unexplained issues presented during the lab. Unclear at this point.
Quick Update: Unclear at this point why I experienced failure ladt run but this run went through. I did input lab name's incorrectly though unsure how that would impact the lab at the step I was at, I presume it would have just excepted the new name as an input variable and keep it moving but still investigating.
Successful validation, Issue's did not persist, though small configuration changes were made that should not have impacted results. Recommend re-running lab with prior configurations to test possible platform issue that has cleared to gain insight.
