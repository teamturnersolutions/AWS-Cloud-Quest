Speech to Text DIY Activity
----------------------------
-Update AWS Lambda code to convert audio files with the WAV format
-Upload the sample WAV audio file (sample_transcribe_3.wav) into the s3 bucket
-Validate the response JSON file recieved in the S3 bucket contains the converted text

###
In Lambda, Reconfigure the S3 Trigger with the 'wav' file format, Then reconfigure the lambda function code
@Line57 with the same file format (MediaFormat='wav'), Ensure that newly configured code has been deployed. 
In S3, Naviagte to the input file with the lab bucket and upload 'sample_transcribe_3.wav'. In Transcribe,
Navigate to 'Transcription jobs' and await the job to be completed. Return to S3, Navigate to the output file
and ensure that the new file is there. Copy the bucket name to a text editor and proceed to Validation.
