Scenario:



Deploying APIs Gradually
--------------------------
-Use AWS SAM command line tools
-Create a new AWS SAM project based on templates
-Build and deploy AWS SAM project
-Deploy a new AWS Lambda function using a canary deployment strategy


Deploying APIs Gradually DIY Activity
--------------------------------------
-Change the deployment preference to 'Linear10PercentEvery1Minute'(Step31)
-Deploy the project by using the new configuration
#Hello_world_function
"new_attribute":"I am a linear deployment"

###
(attempt 1,2&3 Failed) Got to final deployment and both times deployment was not successful
Eventually, mission success. Careful with following along visually in the documentation, Does not align.
I took sometime and did some research and eventually got it to work. Need to repeat results before documenting process.
