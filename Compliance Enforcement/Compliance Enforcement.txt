Compliance Enforcement
--------------------------
Use AWS Config, AWS Systems Manager, and AWS Lambda to ensure compliance of EC2 tagging policies 
and ensure instances have the correct role attached.
-Create an Automation document within AWS systems Manager
-Deploy AWS Config and an AWS Config rule(Required-tags)
-Configure manual remediation
-Remember the HR-AppServer instance

Compliance Enforcement  DIY Activity
---------------------------------------
-Create a new Automation document with AWS Systems Manager
-Deploy a new AWS Config rule(es2-instance-profile-attached)
-Apply any remediation required to make the HR-WebServer instance fully compliant


Validation Process
-------------------
The testing server will query the instance-id of the HR-Webserver EC2 instance to confirm that the right tags and 
IAM instance profile role have been applied.

Hint:
In addition to applying remediation based on the new config rule, Remember to also apply remediation to the 
required-tags Config rule to the HR-Webserver EC2 instance
