Lambda Security
-----------------
-Create an AWS Lambda function, asnd then configure it to connect to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
-Retrieve database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager to access an Amazon RDS database through the 
lambda function
-Create a gateway VPC endpoint to access an Amazon S3 bucket through the lambda function



Lambda Security DIY Activity
-----------------------------
-Update the custom Amazon RDS query in the lambda_function code to find all people records with data
scientist as the occupation
-Upload the new query results into the provided DIY Amazon S3 bucket
-Run the Lambdaa function test event again
-Check that the new query results have been uploaded into the new DIY Amazon S3 bucket

###
DIY activity is the repeat of the last few steps. Put simply, Replace a few keywords in the labFunction.py lambda code that directs the query to look in
the database for 'data scientist' and then redirect it to the DIY bucket required for the DIY Activity
