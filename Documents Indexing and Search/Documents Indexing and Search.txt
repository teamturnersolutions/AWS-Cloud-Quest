Sccenario:
 The bank would like to increase the number of online transactions customers can review from 6 months to five years. In addition, The online bank
statements must support textual searches for all fields in the statement.

Action Plan:
 Deploy an OpenSearch domain to index bank transactions generated from upstream on-premise applications into the OpenSearch domain.

Documents Indexing and Search
-----------------------------
-Deploy and configure an OpenSearch domain
-Create an ETL job using Glue Studio
-Configure an ETL script to ingest S3 data in OpenSearch
-Use the OpenSearch Dashboards to call the search API to query data from the OpenSearch domain

Documents Indexing and Search DIY Activity
-----------------------------------------
-Change "balance" column to "account_balance", and "amount" to "transaction_amount" on your ETL job
-Remove the column k_symbol to avoid it from being indexed
-Change the index name(ie: new-index), and re-run the job

This lab is cloned from the new game Industry Quest or vice versa, Either way I had done this lab before so I was able to breeze thru it the first time. Though I did experience a fault while trying to run a query from the EC2 instance directly via the banking application, Running the query thru kabana gave me no issue's. I experienced this issue before, I believe the issue lies on the server side because subsequent attempts while replicating the process   had been successfull
