Deploying RESTful APIs  DIY Activities
---------------------------------------
-Use the sample file vehicle_function.py to create a new lambda function
-Create a new API Gateway endpoint for vehicles, and integrate it with 
the new lambda function

Solution Validation Method
----------------------------
Validation Process:
Our test service will make two seperate calls to the API Gateway invoke URL. 
The first call will be a GET request to the /vehicles URL to retrieve all
vehicles. The second call will be a GET request to the /vehicles/{id} to 
retieve the details for a single vehicle.
 
Call one: GET /vehicles
{
 [{id:1,...}.{id:2,...}]
}

Call two: GET /vehicles/1
{"id":"1","type":"bike","available":"true"}

Enter your API Gateway URL in the test validation screen to confirm. Include
the /vehicles at the end of the URL.
