###
First Pass Impressions:
 Intrigued, This is a fairly simple yet complex task that I really want to understand more. Furthur investigation required
Slowly running out of time for second pass, Unable to complete DIY at this time. AWS Glue is an extremely intriguing service th
deserves furthur exploration and discovery. Yet to fully grasp its entirety, Looking forward to next attempt.
Second Pass Impressions:
 Successful validation, gained more insight into the process. Feel like a could do it a dozen more times before I fully grasp and master.
As Far as DIY Lab, Follow the Instructions from the Lab, And use the Transaction table instead of customer sales.
