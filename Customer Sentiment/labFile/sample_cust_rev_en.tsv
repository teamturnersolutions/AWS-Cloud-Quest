1662075	I got this item for me and my son to play around with. The closest relevance I have to items like these is while in the army I was trained in the camera rc bots. This thing is awesome we tested the range and got somewhere close to 50 yards without an issue. Getting the controls is a bit tricky at first but after about twenty minutes you get the feel for it. The drone comes just about fly ready you just have to sync the controller. I am definitely a fan of the drones now. Only concern I have is maybe a little more silent but other than that great buy.<br /><br />*Disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.

27225859	Got a wrong product from Amazon Vine and unable to provide a good review. We received a pair of cute girls gloves and a baseball ball instead, while we were expecting a boys batting tee. The gloves are cute, however made for at least 6+ yrs or above...more likely 8-9 yrs old girls.<br /><br />Can't provide a fair review as we were not able to use the product.

25402244	I got these for my daughters for plane trip. I liked that the zipper pouch was attached for markers.  However, that pouch fell off.  But the girls have loved coloring their own stickers. Would def buy this again.
32910511	My girlfriend and I are both into yoga and I gave her a set of the Yoga Joes for her new home yoga room. When she saw them, she was impressed that I had found little green army men like her brother used to play with. Then she realized they were doing yoga and she almost exploded with delight. You should have seen the look on her face. Needless to say, the gift was a huge hit. They are absolutely brilliant!

26599182	We have MANY Wow toys in our home.  We love how well they are made.  The advent calendar is an exception.  The plastic is thinner than our other wow toys and the barn animals won't even stand up on their own due to the head weighing more than the body and uneven base of the toy.  Very disappointing when we love the concept.  The story to read along with everyday is great.  I would have preferred quality (and would have paid more for it) instead of a cheap &#34;knock-off&#34; of the rest of their toy line.  It is very obvious by the weight of the toys sloppy paint jobs which items in our &#34;Wow Toys&#34; bin are part advent calendar vs. the rest of the toys we have.  Also there is a lot of overlap between the wow town advent calendar & winter wonderland calendar, which makes me want to look for alternatives for this year's advent calendar options.
