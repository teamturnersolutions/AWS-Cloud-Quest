Hello, I am Paulo Santos. I used my credit card account 1111-0000-1111-0000 to purchase a microwave oven on Jan 1, 2022. I received the unit and when I opened it, it appeared used. I feel that this was shipped by mistake. I am not happy. Can you resend me the new microwave to 123 Any Street, Seattle, WA 98109. I feel I am losing trust and if someone can reach out to me with an explanation, that is even better.
