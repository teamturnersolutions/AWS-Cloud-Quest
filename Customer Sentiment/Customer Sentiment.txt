Customer Sentiment
------------------
-Use the Amazon Comprehenad AI service to analyze text content
-Configure AWS Lambda to make an API call to Amazon Comprehend to perform sentiment analysis of text files
-Configure Amazon S3 and add an event notification feature to trigger the Lambda function for a PUT event
-Validate the analyzed file recieved in the output S3 bucket


Customer Sentiment DIY Activity
---------------------------------
-Update the AWS Lambda code to run sentiment analysis on french text (Langauge code = fr)
-Upload the sample CSV file (sample_customer_review_fr.csv) into the S3 bucket
-Validate that the analyzed file recieved in the S3 bucket contains the sentiment for each line of the file

###
In Lambda, you need to change the labFunction code to represent French instaed of english <en -to- fr> then configure the lambda s3 trigger 
to represent csv. instead of .tsv. Also, while still in lambda you need to reconfigure the testEvent for the new file that your testing, in this case  
sample_cust_rev_fr. Once those are complete, move to s3 and upload the lab file just named. Return back to lambda and then trigger the test event.
Navigate to Amazon Comprehend/analyze jobs, It will take about 10 minutes for the job to complete, Once in complete status proceed to S3 and copy the 
names of the input and output buckets used in the lab and copy to text editor, You will need that information for Validation

#Sample_File for Step 5
Hello, I am Paulo Santos. I used my credit card account 1111-0000-1111-0000 to purchase a microwave oven on Jan 1, 2022. I received the unit and when I opened it, it appeared used. I feel that this was shipped by mistake. I am not happy. Can you resend me the new microwave to 123 Any Street, Seattle, WA 98109. I feel I am losing trust and if someone can reach out to me with an explanation, that is even better.
